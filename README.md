# gemini-taxbot
The project is a simple chatbot aimed at assisting users in calculating their taxes according to Philippine tax law. This model uses Gemini as it's free to use for developers. Through a series of user prompts, the chatbot collects necessary information such as taxpayer type, income, and filing status, culminating in a tax calculation based on the prompts. Users interact with the chatbot via a Streamlit web application interface with the code written in Python, dependencies are written in a requirements.txt file for streamlit to install. The potential use case for this application are those who are first timers in paying their taxes and want to know how much they should pay based on their salary, employment type and filing status.
